      <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. What information do we collect?</span><br/>
      The Software is an offline application and, in principle, does not actively collect your personally identifiable information (such as name, address, phone number, etc.). However, under certain circumstances, we may collect the following data:
      <br/>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">A. In-app data (non-personal information)</span><br/>
      (1) Game progress, scores, achievements, etc. (stored locally on the device)<br/>
      (2) Device information (e.g., device model, OS version, unique device identifier such as Android ID)<br/>
      (3) Ad interaction data (e.g., ad clicks, impressions)<br/>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">B. AdMob-related data</span><br/>
      This app uses Google AdMob to display ads. AdMob may collect the following information for personalized advertising:<br/>
      (1) Device information (e.g., IP address, device model, operating system)<br/>
      (2) Advertising ID (used for ad targeting; can be reset in device settings)<br/>
      (3) Ad interaction data (e.g., clicks, impressions)<br/>
      For AdMob's privacy policy, please refer to: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google AdMob Privacy Policy</a>
      <br/>
      <br/>
  
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. How do we use this information?</span><br/>
      (1) To provide and optimize the gaming experience (e.g., saving game progress)<br/>
      (2) To display ads (AdMob uses data for ad targeting)<br/>
      (3) To analyze user behavior (improving game design)<br/>
      <br/>
      
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Data storage and security</span><br/>
      (1) Game data is stored locally by default and will be deleted upon uninstallation.<br/>
      (2) AdMob data is processed by Google; we do not have direct access to your personally identifiable information.<br/>
      (3) We implement reasonable security measures to protect data but cannot guarantee 100% security.<br/>
      <br/>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Data sharing</span><br/>
      We do not sell or share your personal data, except in the following cases:<br/>
      (1) AdMob advertising services (Google may collect data for ad delivery)<br/>
      (2) Legal requirements (e.g., government or court orders)<br/>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">5. Your rights</span><br/>
      Depending on your region, you may have the right to:<br/>
      (1) Access, correct, or delete your data (e.g., resetting the Advertising ID)<br/>
      (2) Opt out of personalized ads (disable "Ad Personalization" in device settings)<br/>
      (3) Refuse data collection (though this may affect ad experience)<br/>
      <br/>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">6. Privacy protection for minors</span><br/>
      (1) If you are a minor under the age of 18, please ensure that your parent or guardian reads this Privacy Policy carefully, and only use our services or provide information with their consent.<br/>
      (2) For personal information collected from minors with parental consent, we will only use, share, transfer, or disclose such information when permitted by law, with explicit parental consent, or when necessary to protect the minor.<br/>
      <br/>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">7. Revisions and changes to the Privacy Policy</span><br/>
      We may modify this Privacy Policy. In case of significant changes (e.g., business functions, purposes of use, or updates to privacy-related contact information), the updated version will be published in the app or on our official website. Continued use of our services constitutes acceptance of the revised policy. If you do not agree to the changes, you may uninstall the Software.<br/>
